This app aims to save and share the data of the card game called burraco. In the current version, players can save their scores and share them with registered friends. All data are saved at google Firebase, under control of cloud firestore and Authentication. Players can anonymously use the app to save their data, but an account is required to share them. Some examples of data saved by the app include name of the players, scores of both teams, date of the match, and time off all rounds in a match.
